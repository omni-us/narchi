The initial motivation for starting the development of this package was a desire
to be able to easily change/configure the architecture of a neural network. This
desire lead to a few core decisions:

- The architecture details had to be written in a format designed specifically
  for configuration.

- The configuration of an architecture had to relate only to the architecture of
  the network itself, not on implementation details for it or how it is going to
  be used. Thus the architecture configuration would not include things related
  to:
  * Data loading and preprocessing.
  * Batching.
  * Optimization.
